	<h2>Furthur Into My Interests in Music:</h2>
	<p style="text-align:left;width:500px;height:100px;"> Music has always been apart of my life ever since I was a child. I used to play drums and was huge into rock bands like the Beatles. As of today, I listen to music in the background while doing almost 
	everything, whether it is games, schoolwork, or even taking out the trash. I don&#39;t have a particular favourite genre, however if I were to list a top 3, it would be: 
	<ul>
		<li>Rock</li>
		<li>EDM</li>
		<li>Rap</li>
	</ul>
	</p>

	<h2>Furthur into My Interests in Video Games:</h2>
	<p style="text-align:left;width:500px;height:100px;">
	70% of the time, any ounce of free time I achieve, I spend it on playing video games. Mostly, it is on this online MOBA called League Of Legends. Despite me hating this game, I play it everyday because I am addicted to it like how a drug addict can be addicted to Heroin. 
	My favourite character in this game is Draven, which you can see below.

<h2>Furthur into My Interests in Netflix:</h2>
<p style="text-align:left;width:500px;height:100px;">
During my remaining hours of being awake, I like to watch Netflix shows and movies. My favourite show on Netflix has to be Breaking bad. Currently, I am watching Peaky Blinders,
and Top Boy.

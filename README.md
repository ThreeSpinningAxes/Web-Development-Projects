# Web-Development-Projects
All my web dev projects and labs that I have done.

Links to the websites of each lab are in their respective README.txt files.

The best labs in my opinion would be my lab 5 part 2 (SQL and PHP), lab 3 (Boostrap and Responsive web design), and lab 7 (Jscript and JSON).

Info on other labs:

Lab1 (HTML)
Lab2 (HTML and CSS)
Lab3 (Boostrap Framework and Responsive Web Design)
Lab4 (HTML form with Perl)
Lab5 (PHP and SQL)
Lab6 (ASP, Python, Ruby)
Lab7 (JavaScript and JSON)

                <p> Both ASP.NET and Angular perfomed to our group's expectations. 
                    At first, we were kind of expecting it to be more complicated because the frameworks are 
                    new to us, however, once we got the hang of them, everything turned out perfectly.
                    We are really satisfied with our choice because we get to learn two new frameworks. Even though they are hard,
                    we did not regret at all.
                </p>

                <p> Installing ASP.NET and Angular can be little bit tricky.
                    However, once you figure it out, the rest it pretty much straight-forward.</p>
                

                <p> Hosting ASP.NET and Angular is also challenging because not many servers support ASP.NET. 
                    Our group used <a href="https://somee.com/">Somee</a> to host the demo page, which supports only a simple form of ASP.NET.</p> 


                <p> Creating an ASP.NET project is simple. 
                    Since the framework is language independent, 
                    developers can develop their projects in many languages that target .NET implementations, 
                    our group choice is C#.</p>

                <p> Creating an Angular project is not hard and complicated. 
                    However, it can be tricky to beginners, but once you get the idea and understand what means what, 
                    you will be able to do it easily. </p>

                <p> ASP.NET can be quite a challenge to learn and understand for a beginner and takes time to master, 
                    whereas PHP being a scripting language, is easier to learn and understand. 
                    Hence, the learning curve for ASP.NET might be steep compared with regular HTML/CSS/JavaScript/PHP.</p>

                <p> Learning Angular is not easy if you are new to JavaScript. 
                   Since Angular is a framework for large applications, and with large applications,
                   eventually you'll need abstraction and high-level functions to manage all that JavaScript and performance.
                   Therefore, Angular learning curve is much steeper comapred with 
                   regular HTML/CSS/JavaScript/PHP.</p>
